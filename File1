Database (On SQL Server)

Database
:- an organized collection of structured information, stored and access electronically in a computer system.
:- usually controlled by a database management system.

Comparison between DBMS & RDBMS
DBMS
Data stored in file format
Individual access of data elements
No connection between data
Data in small quantity
Data redundancy is common
There is normalisation
No support for distributed DB
Supports a single user
Lower security
Lower H/W, S/W requirements
Examples: XML, MS Access
RDBMS
Data stored in table format
Multiple data elements accessible
Tablesâ€™ data are linked together
Cannot achieve Normalisation
Data in large amount
Reduced Data redundancy
Supports multiple users
Multiple layers of security
Higher H/W, S/W requirements
Examples: SQL Server, Oracle

Important Terminologies
Normalisation
Process of organizing data in a database, which includes creating tables and establishing relationship between those tables, in order to provide protection and flexibility to both data and database respectively.
Distributed Database
Collection of multiple logically interrelated databases distributed over a computer network.
Data Redundancy
Practice of keeping data in 2 or more places within a database or data storage system.
Data Integrity
Overall completeness, accuracy, and consistency of data over its entire life cycle.
By data integrity, it ensures that data-in-use, data-in-transit and data-at-rest cannot be changed by an unauthorized person or program.
Types of Data
Nominal, Ordinal, Discrete, and Continuous
